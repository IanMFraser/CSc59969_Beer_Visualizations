# Craft Beer Visualization Project

A simple visualization showing the growth of craft beer in the United States from 1984 to 2017. The dataset for this visualization was taking from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/brewery-count-by-state-1984-march-31-2017). The visualization was created using D3 for my Vizualization course at City College of New York.
