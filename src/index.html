    <h2>Brewery Count By State 1984-2017.</h2>
    <p>For this visualization, we used the Brewery Count By State (1984 - March 31, 2017)
       dataset found on data.gov from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. 
       As described in the title, this dataset lists the number of breweries per state 
       in the United States from 1984 to early 2017. </p>
    <p>The reason we wanted to visualize this dataset was because of how clearly it
       helps to show the growth of the craft beer industry in such a short amount of
        time. In 1984, there was only 5 states in the US that were manufacturing beer; 
        Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Texas, California and Washington. This was a total of 
        26 breweries producing for the whole country. Only ten years later, all but 8 
        states have started producing beer. By 1999, every state had at least 3 breweries, 
        and in some cases, some states had several hundred.</p>
    <p>To make this visualization, we chose a D3 template found on the D3 website in 
      the Maps examples. This was a fairly straight forward example that takes a CSV 
      file as input, where each column is a list of some value per year. In the example 
      dataset they used population per state per year. We didn’t feel that we needed 
      anything too complex for this vis, we just wanted to show the growth per state 
      per year. As production grows, the color of the state becomes darker, so it’s 
      clear to the user which state has a larger production value. </p>
    <p>The original dataset from data.gov did need to be cleaned up a little bit in 
      order to use it in this dataset. The main thing we needed to clean up was 
      dropping a row that listed “other” US territories as these weren’t included in 
      the map. There was also a row that listed total brewery count per year, which 
      we didn’t think was necessary for the vis.  Finally, the original datasets 
      used State abbreviations, and our vis required full state names listed in 
      alphabetical order, so some rearranging of the rows was needed for the data 
      to be properly formatted into the map. </p>
      <p>Once we were able to get the data properly formatted and loaded into our 
        visualization, we stripped apart the d3 code, so that we could properly 
        display the number of breweries per state when the user mouses over the 
        state. This way, if the color of the state isn’t clear to how much 
        production was made, they could see a specific value associated with that 
        state.</p>
